This is the code to reproduce our ICML2025 paper titled **“Grokking Beyond the Euclidean Norm of Model Parameters.”**

Below, you will find the notebook to use to reproduce each figure.
* For compressed sensing and matrix factorization, the experiments do not use GPUs; CPUs are enough: the routines are implemented with `numpy`.
* For the other experiments (modular addition with MLP, non-linear teacher-student, Sobolev training, MNIST with MLP), a single GPU (specifically, the T4 GPU from Google Colab) is sufficient.

The notebooks are included in the code.
